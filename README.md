## Prospective Ph.D Student in Computational Drug Discovery

I am an aspiring computational drug discovery researcher planning to leverage my experience in AI and programming to advance the field of drug development through innovative computational methods. During my PhD research, I aim to investigate how computational approaches can enhance our understanding of drug-protein interactions, particularly focusing on membrane protein targets. I am most intrigued by the application of AI and computer vision in drug discovery, having developed a computer vision-based system for parenteral medication recognition that demonstrates the potential of AI in pharmaceutical applications.

My research interests center on developing computational methods for drug discovery, particularly in:
- Membrane protein targeting and interaction modeling
- AI-driven drug candidate screening and optimization
- Computer vision applications in pharmaceutical safety
- Integration of biological knowledge with computational approaches

During my work on the parenteral medication recognition system, I developed expertise in:
- Image preprocessing techniques for pharmaceutical applications
- Environmental adaptation algorithms for real-world deployment
- Deep learning models for drug identification
- Quality analysis methodologies for pharmaceutical imaging

Bullet points of accomplishments or personal qualities to highlight:
- The privilege to develop and lead AI workshops at SUTD AI Interest Group, growing from 10 to 400+ members in 2 months, demonstrates my ability to communicate complex technical concepts and build collaborative communities
- My background in GCE A-Level H2 Biology and ACE Physical Trainer certification provides a strong foundation in understanding biological systems, which complements my computational expertise
- My work on the computer vision-based medication detection system showcases my ability to apply computational methods to real-world pharmaceutical challenges
- As a Teaching Assistant for Computational Design Thinking, I've demonstrated my ability to break down complex computational problems and communicate solutions effectively

I am particularly interested in combining my programming expertise (Python, JavaScript, C#) with biological knowledge to develop novel computational approaches for drug discovery. My experience in image preprocessing and machine learning, particularly demonstrated in my [GitHub project](https://github.com/dnoma/parenteral), shows my capability to handle complex computational challenges in pharmaceutical applications.

My independent research on Computational Drug Development for Membrane Protein Targets has given me valuable insights into the intersection of computational methods and biological systems. This work, combined with my practical experience in developing AI systems for pharmaceutical applications, has prepared me well for advancing research in computational drug discovery.

I am very adaptable and resilient, as demonstrated by my ability to manage both technical development and community building in the SUTD AI Interest Group while maintaining focus on research objectives. My experience in preprocessing datasets for uncontrolled environments shows my ability to tackle real-world challenges in drug discovery applications.

The opportunity to pursue this research under Prof. Loke's supervision would allow me to contribute to the advancement of computational methods in drug discovery while building on his expertise in novel materials and medical technologies. I am excited about the possibility of combining computational approaches with materials science to develop innovative solutions for drug development challenges.
